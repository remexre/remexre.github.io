<h1 id="short-term-plans-next-semester">Short-Term Plans (Next Semester)</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Silver: Finish highlighting, maybe take a look at LSP? Perf still seems
problematic, though if the Eclipse plugin's performance is less bad than
Monto 3's was, seems like there's still low-hanging fruit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Algebraic Effects for ableC: The <a href="https://github.com/koka-lang/koka">Koka</a> group recently had a talk on
how they compile their language (with algebraic effects) to efficient C. I
think the same approach should work to implement an algebraic effects
extension for ableC too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stahl eliminators: In theory, I should be able to define a function that
recurses over the definition of a datatype to be act as an
eliminator/induction principle for it. The original levitation paper defines
one, but their formulation doesn't work for the cleaned-up representation for
datatypes I'm using (from A Practical Guide to Levitation). I've been toying
with a different representation that I hope would make defining the generic
eliminator easier, and improve the performance of a naive compiled
implementation, so hopefully that works?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="long-term-plans-thesis">Long-Term Plans (Thesis?)</h1>
<h2 id="algebraic-effects-in-stahl">Algebraic Effects in Stahl</h2>
<p>I think either linear types (or one of its extensions, such as quantitative
type theory) or /maybe/ coinduction might be able to fix the soundness issues?
I don't know how to do the proofs of soundness for MLTT (or dependent type
theories in general), so I'd need to learn to do those first.</p>
<h2 id="cubical-levitation">Cubical Levitation</h2>
<p>Even if I get the Stahl eliminators item above working, Stahl still won't have
everything present in most HoTT/Cubical type theories. The biggest item is
higher inductive types (HITs). I don't think these should actually be too
incredibly hard to work in, but I don't know what soundness problems exist with
HITs, and I should like, actually learn the mathematical model behind cubical
type theory.</p>
<h2 id="formally-verifying-stahlos">Formally Verifying StahlOS</h2>
<p>The parts of the implementation that (in my opinion at least) it makes sense to
formally verify are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Eremexre/stahlos/tree/7bf2eb256167be5b7093a32d8819707d1bca1286/src/kernel-aarch64/forth/builtins.s">builtins</a>, which I'd probably need to define axiomatically in the
high-level semantics.</li>
<li>the &quot;<a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Eremexre/stahlos/tree/7bf2eb256167be5b7093a32d8819707d1bca1286/src/kernel-aarch64/forth/pseudobuiltins.s">pseudobuiltins</a>&quot;, which are basically just hand-compiled code that
should be identical (or nearly so) to what the normal compiler would output.</li>
<li>the first file of the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Eremexre/stahlos/tree/7bf2eb256167be5b7093a32d8819707d1bca1286/src/kernel-aarch64/init/init.fth">init process</a>, which defines functions, IF,
loops, string literals, and a lot of other stuff that would normally be built
into the language itself.</li>
<li>a simple <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Eremexre/stahlos/tree/7bf2eb256167be5b7093a32d8819707d1bca1286/src/kernel-aarch64/init/repl.fth">REPL</a> that runs over the serial port.</li>
</ul>
<p>This notably excludes the serial driver and the bootloader, but I think I'd
like to try and verify everything from when the bootloader hands off to the
kernel on.</p>
<p>I think this would probably have me learning separation logic, and possibly one
of the theorem provers with better support for calling an SMT solver (e.g.
Isabelle, though I remember a paper about extending Coq with one).</p>
