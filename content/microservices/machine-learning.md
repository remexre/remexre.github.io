# Machine Learning Worker

## Overview

Machine Learning should generally be done "offline," i.e. not in response to user requests, but on the user's data, processing at all times.

## Tech Recommendation

This'd probably have to be in Python, sadly.
If you do your ML in any other language, it makes sense to use too.
